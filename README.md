I've taken my lecturer's feedback and implemented what i understood from it to my code.
The CMCS is a web-based application designed to streamline the submission, verification, and approval of claims for Independent Contractor (IC) lecturers. 
Lecturers can submit claims with auto-calculated payments, Programme Coordinators review and approve claims, and HR generates reports and manages data. 
Built using ASP.NET Core, Entity Framework, and SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS), the system automates processes, reduces errors, and improves communication between stakeholders. 
To set up, clone the repository, configure the database, run migrations, and start the application.
